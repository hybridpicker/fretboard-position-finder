      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This web app was born out of a passion for supporting guitarists of all levels in expanding their skills and developing a deeper understanding of their instrument. As a guitar teacher and musician, it was my heartfelt desire to create a tool that would not only support my students but also assist me in my daily practice.</p>
      <p>Guitar-positions.org generates all possible fingerings for guitarists in all keys and positions. Our app is organized into categories to make navigation easier:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scales:</strong> From pentatonic scales to melodic minor scales and symmetrical scales.</li>
        <li><strong>Arpeggios:</strong> Triads- and Seventh Chord-Arpeggios.</li>
        <li><strong>Chords:</strong> Triads and Seventh Chords.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether you are looking for simple triads, spread triads, or more complex chords, our app provides you with a comprehensive collection of fretboard diagrams and positions to help you find and master all the notes on the guitar fretboard.</p>
      <p>Our app is ideal for students who want to improve their technique as well as advanced guitarists seeking new challenges. With guitar-positions.org, you can take your musical journey to the next level.</p>
      <p>This app is an open-source project. We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the code or provide feedback. You can reach us anytime at <a href="mailto:lukas@schoensgibl.com">lukas@schoensgibl.com</a>.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0;">Enjoy practicing and discovering!</p>

    <!-- Search Logic section -->
    <div class="search-logic-section">
      <h2>How the Search Works</h2>
      <p>The search feature is designed to help you quickly find the exact scales, chords, or arpeggios you need on the guitar fretboard. When you enter a query, the app intelligently matches your input against a comprehensive database of fingerings and positions for all keys and categories. It supports partial names, synonyms, and even common abbreviations—so you can search for "maj7", "minor pentatonic", or "C7" and get relevant results instantly.<br><br>
        The search logic prioritizes clarity and speed, filtering results in real-time as you type. It also recognizes enharmonic equivalents (like C# and Db) and offers suggestions if your query is ambiguous. This ensures you always find the position or diagram that fits your musical needs, whether you're exploring new scales or looking for a specific chord voicing.
