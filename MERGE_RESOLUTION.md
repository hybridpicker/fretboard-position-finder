# Merge Resolution: eight-String into devel

## Overview

Successfully merged the eight-string guitar functionality from the `eight-String` branch into the `devel` branch while preserving important features from both branches.

## Approach Taken

Instead of trying to directly merge the divergent branches, we created a new branch based on `devel` and selectively integrated eight-string functionality:

1. Created a `devel-with-eight-string` branch based on `devel`
2. Added 8-string specific array entries and note definitions to preserve the note name functionality
3. Added height synchronization function from `eight-String` branch
4. Created string configuration toggle UI
5. Added SVG files for both 6-string and 8-string fretboard display
6. Updated view helpers and templates to support both string configurations
7. Added a CSS file specifically for eight-string display
8. Tested integration to ensure functionality from both branches was preserved
9. Created detailed documentation

## Conflicts Resolved

- **String Array Definition**: Modified to include both the high A and low B strings while keeping the same structure
- **Note Definitions**: Added the note definitions for the new strings while preserving the original format
- **CSS/SVG Structure**: Created new directory structure to handle both fretboard types
- **UI Logic**: Added string configuration toggle while preserving the original UI layout
- **Note Name Functionality**: Ensured the 'n' shortcut and note name display worked in both modes
- **Backend Views**: Updated all view files to handle the additional string configuration

## Testing

The integrated branch has been tested for:
- Correct display of both 6-string and 8-string fretboards
- Proper functionality of the string configuration toggle
- Preservation of note name display and shortcuts
- Proper CSS styling in both configurations
- Height synchronization for the lowest string

## How to Use

1. Normal 6-string mode is the default
2. Click the "Switch to 8-string mode" button to toggle between modes
3. The fretboard will update to show the high A and low B strings when in 8-string mode
4. All other functionality (scales, arpeggios, chords, note names) works in both modes

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include:
- Database entries specifically for 8-string chord voicings
- Different tuning options for both 6 and 8 string modes
- Mobile-specific optimizations for the larger 8-string display
- Custom string configuration beyond just 6 or 8 strings
