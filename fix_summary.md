# A Minor Pentatonic Arpeggio Bug Fix

## Issue
The search function was not correctly finding A minor pentatonic arpeggio due to the following issues:

1. There were no arpeggio entries in the database for the Arpeggios category
2. The search function was looking for a root ID (14) but arpeggios use pitch (9) for note A
3. The URL generation wasn't correctly pointing to the right arpeggios

## Fix Summary

### 1. Added Missing Arpeggio Data
- Created `add_arpeggios.py` to add pentatonic arpeggios for all 12 root notes
- Added support for both minor and major pentatonic arpeggios
- Created extended range versions for 8-string guitars

### 2. Fixed Root Note Handling
- Updated `search_arpeggios` function to correctly map between note IDs and pitch values
- Now properly finds arpeggios for note A (ID 14) by searching with pitch value 9
- Added better error handling and logging for debugging

### 3. Fixed URL Generation
- Updated URL generation in `process_arpeggio_results` function
- Now correctly links to arpeggios with the proper models_select=2 parameter
- Added proper root ID lookup for correct URL generation

## Testing
We verified that A minor pentatonic arpeggios now appear correctly in search results
and generate the proper URL for displaying the fretboard position.

## Recommendations
1. Consider updating other search functions to harmonize the note ID/pitch mapping
2. Add more arpeggios for different chord types (e.g., maj7, dom7, etc.)
3. Create a test suite to verify search functionality
