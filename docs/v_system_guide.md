# Ted Greene's V-System Guide

The V-System is a comprehensive method for organizing chord voicings developed by legendary jazz guitarist Ted Greene. It provides a structured way to understand and categorize the countless chord shapes available on the guitar.

## What is the V-System?

The V-System classifies chord voicings into 14 "Voicing Groups" (V-1 through V-14) based on their spacing pattern. This framework helps guitarists understand and navigate the "vast sea of chords" in an organized way.

Instead of memorizing hundreds of chord shapes randomly, you can understand them as systematic variations of basic spacing patterns.

## V-System Voicing Groups

### V-1: Close Position

All four notes are arranged as close together as possible, with no chord tone between any two notes. These voicings span less than an octave from lowest to highest note.

- Perfect for learning harmony fundamentals
- Can be challenging to play on guitar due to stretches
- Creates a dense, compact sound

### V-2: Drop 2 Voicings

The second-highest note of a close-position chord is "dropped" down an octave. These are often called "Wes chords" after Wes Montgomery who frequently used them for comping.

- Very common in jazz guitar
- Comfortable to play on middle 4 strings or top 4 strings
- Good balance of closeness and openness

### V-3: Drop 3 Voicings

The third-highest note is dropped an octave. These voicings have the bottom three notes close together while the top note is isolated.

- Good for situations where you want the melody note to stand out
- Can provide clearer bass separation
- Mirror-image of V-2 voicings

### V-4: Freddie Green Style

These open voicings are associated with "Freddie Green chords" - the three-note rhythm chords used in big band swing comping.

- Often have the 3rd and 7th plus either root or fifth
- Essential for swing rhythm playing
- Very playable across a variety of string groups

### V-5 through V-14

As the voicing group number increases, the spacings become progressively wider and more unusual.

- V-5 through V-10: Wider-spaced but still musically useful
- V-11 through V-14: Extremely large stretches, mostly of theoretical interest

## Using the V-System in This Application

This application implements V-1 and V-2 voicings to help you explore close position and drop-2 voicings systematically:

1. Select "V1" or "V2" from the Type dropdown
2. Choose your desired chord quality (Major 7, Dominant 7, etc.)
3. Select your root note
4. Explore different string sets using the Range dropdown

### Benefits of the V-System Approach

- Learn chord voicings systematically instead of randomly
- Understand the relationship between different voicing types
- More easily transpose and adapt voicings to different musical contexts
- Develop a comprehensive fretboard knowledge

## Extended-Range Guitars and the V-System

The V-System extends naturally to 7- and 8-string guitars. This application supports V-System voicings across the extended range of 8-string guitars, giving you access to deeper bass notes and higher melody notes.

When using an 8-string guitar, explore the additional string sets in the Range dropdown that include "lowB" and "highA" strings.

## Further Exploration

As you become comfortable with V-1 and V-2 voicings, you can experiment with creating your own V-3 and V-4 voicings by applying the dropping pattern principles described above.
